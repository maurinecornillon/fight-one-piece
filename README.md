# Batlle Fight One Piece by Maurine Cornillon

# Why I choose this game?

When we discovered canvas and all these possibilities I wanted to challenge myself. Firstly I wanted to create a fighting game in the universe of Attack on Titan because it's my favorite manga but it was so hard to find assets and sprites for the characters. So i decided to choose an other universe : One Piece because it's the favorite manga of my boyfriend and he loves to play.
